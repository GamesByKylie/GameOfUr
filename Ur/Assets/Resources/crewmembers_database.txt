When Roman ambassadors came to Illyria to persuade her to rein in the pirates, she listened to them 'in a most arrogant and overbearing manner', and informed them that in Illyrian law, piracy was lawful trade and a private enterprise, and it was not the custom of royalty to prevent their subjects from profiting as they could from the sea. The Romans responded that they had customs as well - punishing wrongdoers, and protecting victims. Teuta was so enraged that she had the ambassadors' ship seized, and one ambassador put to death.%(Polybius Histories 2.6-8)
