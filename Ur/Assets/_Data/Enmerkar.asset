  characterInfo: Enmerkar was an ancient Sumerian hero and the King of Uruk. He is
    a real historical figure who lived between the end of the 4th and start of the
    3rd millennium BC. He was known as the son of the sun god Utu, brother of the
    goddess Inanna. He warred against the rival city Aratta, whose wealth in stone
